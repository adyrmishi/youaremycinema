# You Are My Cinema

## Description

You Are My Cinema is a website I'm creating to list all showings of a particular film within a user's required radius. Currently you can put a postcode in and a set distance restriction, and be returned all cinemas fitting the requirement as well as a link to their website.

This website is using the Google Maps API.
